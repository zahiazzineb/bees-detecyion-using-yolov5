Varroa mites are one of the most destructive pests of honey bees. Adult female varroa mites lay their eggs in the brood cells of bee hives. The mites feed on bee larvae and pupae, resulting in deformation of the wings and bodies of bees when they develop and emerge as adults. They also feed on adult bees.
